We got up and packed everything away - we are well practised at this now! We were away by 10.30, although I would have liked another day by the pool. We set off along the beautiful coast road in the baking heat and it wasn&#39;t long before we were bombarded by mopeds darting everywhere. They even drive along the pavement if they can&#39;t squash between the cars. The mopeds plus the heat plus the state of the Italian roads made for a stressful journey despite the views. Also my neck pain is getting worse so we have to stop more frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making it through the traffic of San Remo, we stopped for lunch. We both really wanted some authentic Italian carbonara so we sought out a place serving it. We found a restaurant and had a hard time ordering as our original waiter spoke no English. He found a waiter who supposedly spoke English but it was so accented we couldn&#39;t understand it! He spent ages asking if we wanted gas in our water and then accused us of not being able to speak much English. He was then muchly surprised that we only wanted one course. But eventually we got some carbonara and it was very yummy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5152423236900896066&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh6.google.com/B.Hymers/R4EVop_yPUI/AAAAAAAAAWY/sVOJqL4qkwQ/s144/100_0407.JPG&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We then continued towards Nice. As we crossed the border into France the mopeds disappeared but the heat did not. We made it to Nice OK, but then got lost for a good couple of hours in the centre. Our radios ran out of battery which was a real nuisance as we couldn&#39;t help each other find the way. Eventually we got out of Nice, straight into more traffic jams!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We didn&#39;t find the campsite we were looking for. We are at a cheap campsite but it has no normal toilets, only outside showers and the owner doesn&#39;t speak English! She does however have a very cute dog, but this does not make up for the rest of it! Hopefully tomorrow we will find our campsite quickly and have a trip into Nice.&lt;/p&gt;</textarea></td></tr>
