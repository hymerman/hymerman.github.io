We woke up, got ready and packed very early, got back on the road and continued to the site we were supposed to have found last night. It&#39;s considerably nicer here, but a lot more expensive than our book said it would be. We got the last pitch available, probably why it was so pricey! The staff aren&#39;t too friendly though, they refused to charge our radios for us, something even the dingiest of other sites have done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we set up early enough to make a full day of it, so we caught the bus into Cannes (as it is very close, and Tim and Emsy seemed to like it!). We arrived and almost immediately got caught up in a lively market area.&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5152423275555601746&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh3.google.com/B.Hymers/R4EVq5_yPVI/AAAAAAAAAWg/b5J8lbXr5FU/s144/100_0408.JPG&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I&#39;ve been in many a market before, but this particular one was somehow different -  a lot more friendly and interesting for a start. We liked it, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were quite hungry already, so headed through the narrow streets to the seafront, with its many splendid restaurants. We walked past the splendid ones and found a nice cheap one, offering a three course meal for €9.40, a deal we just couldn&#39;t pass up! The salad was great as it was mostly ham and cheese, but my burger tasted of charcoal and Helen&#39;s pizza was mostly made of mushrooms (not as advertised!). The ice cream was delicious though! Overall, a reasonable meal at a reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More wandering led us to the port, which was certainly an eye-opener! There were some &lt;strong&gt;massive&lt;/strong&gt; yachts moored there, and some even more extravagant ones out in the bay. The port is right next to the beach, which was like any other beach we&#39;ve seen, albeit with more people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5152423314210307426&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh4.google.com/B.Hymers/R4EVtJ_yPWI/AAAAAAAAAWo/pJK5mDWF4g8/s144/100_0415.JPG&quot; class=&quot;alignright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We walked back through the town to the West side, and climbed up towards a lovely little church, tower and section of original wall- the old part of town. This provided some great views and a bit of a break from the hustle and bustle below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a quick beer stop and a hike to the internet café to put the contents of the camera on CD (cheaper than a new memory card), we made our way back to the bus station and came back to the campsite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5152423348570045810&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh4.google.com/B.Hymers/R4EVvJ_yPXI/AAAAAAAAAWw/YDo0BOb3fWI/s144/100_0416.jpg&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;All in all, I liked Cannes a lot. We didn&#39;t see any particularly impressive sights; it just seemed to feel like a good place to be. It&#39;s a pity we have to leave tomorrow though, it would have been nice to see Nice, Monaco and St. Tropez! Oh well, Ardeche here we come!&lt;/p&gt;</textarea></td></tr>
