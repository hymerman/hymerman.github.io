Getting there was a little odd as there weren&#39;t any nice guides given to us, and the signs around us gave us no clues. We crossed the bridge nearby (which took a while, it&#39;s quite a huge lump of metal!) and found a tram stop which we figured would take us to the town centre. There wasn&#39;t a town centre marked on the map but one of the stops was written in bold, so we went for that one. We couldn&#39;t get tickets as there was basically nothing at the stop, which puzzled us. Once we got on, we still had no idea how to pay. We changed at Uberring, and found on the next tram that there was a ticket machine, but unfortunately the card slot wouldn&#39;t take any of our cards! As such, we rather cheekily got away without paying â‚¬9.60!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5109695423901209154&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh6.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/RulI6mwSEkI/AAAAAAAAAPY/hruyY14eYl4/s144/100_0030.JPG&quot; class=&quot;alignright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Straight out of the station, we were greeted by the cathedral, a rather impressive piece of architecture to say the least. It took a long time before I was far enough away to fit the whole thing in one photo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wandered around the town for a bit, which was pretty average. We had a roll each from another lovely bakery, then a stroll along the riverside. &lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5109695518390489682&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh4.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/RulJAGwSElI/AAAAAAAAAPg/1GAx0pKW6dw/s144/100_0036.JPG&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We found some interestingly colourful little shops and had a delicious ice cream from one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, the tour was a little more slapdash... we didn&#39;t have a map or any idea where the interesting bits were meant to be! After spending quite some time stumbling around the backstreets past construction yards and hotels, we got back to the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than leave straight away we decided to poke around inside the cathedral, which turned out to be even more impressive on the inside. We could but imagine how long it all took to build, it really is stupidly large and elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then found an Aldi and stocked up on breakfast stuff as well as buying our dinner. Tortellini and mini salamis, delicious!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I guess Koln was a nice enough place, though lacked character when compared to Amsterdam, culture when compared to Brugge, and grandeur when compared to Rotterdam. Germany will have to try better with the next town we visit.&lt;/p&gt;</textarea></td></tr>
