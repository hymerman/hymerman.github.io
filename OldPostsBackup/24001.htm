It turns out there are far more than we had imagined, but we set off for one in particular we had the leaflet of, called Viking Bateaux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5152423481714032034&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh3.google.com/B.Hymers/R4EV25_yPaI/AAAAAAAAAXI/K2Yy-ikohfY/s144/100_0442.jpg&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Before that, we had to head off to a nearby L&#39;Eclerc for some engine oil for Helen&#39;s bike, which had been overheating a lot recently. We had lunch as well and were on our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey took us along a lot of winding roads through the upper part of the Ardeche gorge and several lovely looking towns and villages. I stopped to take photos a couple of times - much to the annoyance of Helen, since she was getting very hot and bothered due to the heat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got to the small town of Salvalas (?) alongside the Ardeche itself, but didn&#39;t see Viking Bateaux anywhere, Apparently I misread the leaflet, and that&#39;s only where the canoes leave from! We walked into one of the many other trip-organiser-y places there were in town to see if we could get on their river trips. After a long phone call, the lady in charge said there were 2 spaces available - perfect!&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5152423524663705010&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh5.google.com/B.Hymers/R4EV5Z_yPbI/AAAAAAAAAXQ/lFdqLFpj830/s144/100_0443.jpg&quot; class=&quot;alignright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I went and told Helen, but when I went back to the office to accept and pay, she said I was too late - another couple had arrived during those 5 minutes, ironically whilst we were moving our bikes out of the way of their equipment! I was very displeased, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helen was very hot and very bothered by this point, so we didn&#39;t go to any of the other places, and instead walked down to the river to paddle a bit and spy on fish.&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5152423571908345282&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh4.google.com/B.Hymers/R4EV8J_yPcI/AAAAAAAAAXY/pTG24CwvNoc/s144/100_0449.jpg&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; We&#39;re staying another night here, so we&#39;ll go kayaking/canoeing tomorrow instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We came back to the campsite, had a dip in the pool (stealthily as I was breaking the “no Bermuda shorts” rule), then went to the restaurant. Helen had roast chicken, and I had “Carpaccio de boeuf” - which turned out to be a great big plate of raw beef! It was actually very nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we&#39;re sat in the tent ready for bed (after a game of cards and a quick go on Mario). I&#39;m quite looking forward to getting on the water again!&lt;/p&gt;</textarea></td></tr>
