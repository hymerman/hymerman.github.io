&lt;p&gt;Helen woke up early to have a shower and do everything that needed doing, while I snoozed in my sleeping bag. It was hard work, but I got through it. I eventually woke up and we had breakfast and so on, and prepared to leave for Zürich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This excursion was a little different, we went on the bikes assuming public transport would be a little poor in the Alps! It turns out they do have pretty good trains, but I quite enjoyed the ride anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once there, we cheekily parked up in a shopping centre next to a few mopeds, changed into ordinary clothes and set off in search of tourist information so we could figure out where we were! It turned out to be in the central train station just up the road, and they had some pretty good maps and information available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next port of call was an internet café so Helen could send an email to her Dad about some bike problems. We were going to eat there too, but for the first time on the trip we found the food unappetising!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this we wandered the streets for a café to eat at, but everywhere was very expensive. We ended up having a Panini back at the station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5113183515221071698&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh4.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/RvWtUPgil1I/AAAAAAAAAQk/QWKbrkwWAis/s144/100_0159.JPG&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Next we figured it was time to explore a bit more of Zürich, since we&#39;d only seen the main high-street so far, which was just like every other high street in the world. We headed out of the station north, towards some nice looking gardens and the sound of a jazz band, and stumbled upon the Zürich museum. We felt like we should probably get a little culture and stepped inside. 3 hours later, at closing time, we left! It was very interesting, especially the arms and armour exhibit and the pre and early history exhibits. Everything there was to do with Switzerland and Zürich, and their history, and it proved absolutely fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5113183631185188706&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh3.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/RvWta_gil2I/AAAAAAAAAQs/ZGG8p9VlOEU/s144/100_0169.JPG&quot; class=&quot;alignright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After we left, we went through the park, over a bridge and walked more or less the whole length of the river towards the lake (or “see” as the Swiss call it). The buildings, save for churches and so on, were generally unremarkable along the waterfront. &lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5113183764329174914&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh6.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/RvWtivgil4I/AAAAAAAAAQ8/4cA9G1lrwDM/s144/100_0195.JPG&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Off the waterfront, though, the streets turned very steep and winding and the shops and buildings turned very eclectic and colourful - it all looked absolutely splendid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5113183682724796274&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh3.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/RvWtd_gil3I/AAAAAAAAAQ0/vQ0bhPimI8k/s144/100_0185.JPG&quot; class=&quot;alignright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;We followed the route to the lake, which turned out to also be quite amazing! The sun over the water, and the tree-covered hilltops surrounding the lake were amazing. I&#39;d pile on more praise, but I&#39;m reserving all that for Geneva...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few photos later and we headed back towards the bikes, which proved a little difficult due to the odd little roads and very steep hills. We rode back to the campsite, de-kitted, had more Bratwurst for dinner then went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;</textarea></td></tr>
