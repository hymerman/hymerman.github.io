It was a particularly bad singer, singing along to what sounded like either a karaoke machine or a Casio keyboard, I don&#39;t know which. The ‘fun&#39; part was that all the songs were either Italian, or British songs sung with Italian words, all with the same monotonous euro-pop beat. This went on constantly for 2 and a half hours (would have been 2, but his Italian audience kept demanding encores). The ‘top&#39; moment was the odd mix of an Italian ‘California Dreamin&#39;&#39; with an Italian ‘Stand by me&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we woke up fairly late and hung around for a while. Once we could be bothered, we set off for the nearby town of Ceriale on foot. The walk was interesting, as most of the buildings between the campsite and town appear to be disused industrial... things. Very pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.com/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5152423189656255794&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh3.google.com/B.Hymers/R4EVl5_yPTI/AAAAAAAAAWQ/P2yu-iSW-hA/s144/100_0401.JPG&quot; class=&quot;alignright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Once there, though, things brightened up considerably. Ceriale is a busy little seaside resort, and is a lot more fun on foot when you have time to take in the sights! After a bit of a stroll, and a bit of a laugh at the people exercising in the sea, we stopped at a little pizzeria called ‘La Grotta&#39;. It was very interesting, half below ground, and filled with odd bits and pieces. The food was delicious - I had a spicy salami pizza and Helen had ham and Wurstel (sausage). It was also very cheap which I liked a lot!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wandered along to a gelateria for an ice cream after that. I had a yummy creamy ice cream with chunks of meringue and chocolate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We walked back to the site and promptly jumped into the pool. The rest of the afternoon and most of the evening was spent either in or by the pool, which made a nice change of pace for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the evening, we ate dinner at the campsite, which was also very cheap, though not as delicious as expected. I had gnocchi and Helen had penne pasta, each with a crazy tomato sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, rather than go back to the tent and moan about the noise, we hung around for the evening&#39;s entertainment. It was an odd pair of Italian clowns, who I&#39;m sure were very funny, but we couldn&#39;t understand a word of what they said! After popping many balloons, throwing many knives, playing musical chairs and making men lean on each other in humorous ways, we got tired and left. All in all, a nice, lazy day. I like. :)&lt;/p&gt;</textarea></td></tr>
