It is pretty much impossible to sleep any later than this due to the heat in the tent and the noise of all the surrounding foreigners! We packed up in the dust and left, heading along the coast road.&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5152423039332400370&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh4.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/R4EVdJ_yPPI/AAAAAAAAAVs/akLBTYFd88M/s144/100_0386.JPG&quot; class=&quot;alignright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It was very warm; a pharmacy we passed displayed 32°C and it was much warmer in boots, gloves, helmet and jacket! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5152423095166975234&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh5.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/R4EVgZ_yPQI/AAAAAAAAAV0/dKKTaANc7nE/s144/100_0388.JPG&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The bits of roads winding along the cliffs looking out over the blue water were lovely, but the bits through the coastal towns were not so good. Italy is full of moped drivers who dart in and out of everywhere, and are very unpredictable. They made the hot journey a bit stressful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After less than an hours drive we arrived at our chosen campsite - camping Baccicia. We were going to be charged an extortionate amount, but Ben managed to barter it down to €25 a night, which is still on the expensive side but much better than what the man originally asked for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben had a hard time setting up the tent due to the extremely hard ground, but with the aid of a mallet borrowed from reception he managed. After setting up and finally doing some washing (!) we paid €6 for a trip to the resorts private beach. Literally the second we stepped out of the office the sun went behind a huge cloud and did not properly come out again for the rest of the day! None-the-less, we went to the beach.&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5152423133821680914&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh6.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/R4EVip_yPRI/AAAAAAAAAWA/rXGuV92Cm4w/s144/100_0391.JPG&quot; class=&quot;alignright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; It was rather nice as our ticket included 2 sun loungers and an umbrella. Ben coaxed me into the sea for a swim. The water was actually quite warm and the waves were fun. We got out because we hadn&#39;t had lunch and by this time it was getting on for 4. We both had a burger at the beach side café and Ben had a beer.&lt;a href=&quot;http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/EuropeTrip/photo#5152423151001550114&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://lh6.google.co.uk/B.Hymers/R4EVjp_yPSI/AAAAAAAAAWI/YHNVA_Encgs/s144/100_0394.JPG&quot; class=&quot;alignleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; But then it began to spot with rain so we caught the bus back to camp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we hung around doing not much. As the sun had gone in it became comfortable to sit in the tent again, so we took the opportunity to relax. Later we had dinner - a tin of pasta tubes with beef in from the supermarket, but it was really unpleasant! So we had to have an ice cream from the shop to make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the sun is going down as I write this and Ben is playing on his game. We are hoping to relax tomorrow, explore a bit and maybe take a dip in the campsites pool, before going onto Nice the next day.&lt;/p&gt;</textarea></td></tr>
