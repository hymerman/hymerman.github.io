We had some pannier issues but these were solved by a squirt of good old WD40. We had a fast journey to Dover with one stop for petrol, but we were held up by queues at passport control, and we were told that we were too late for the 9.30 ferry. So £20 less well off we were queuing for the 11am ferry instead. We got chatting to some other bikers in the queue who were off on a day trip to Belgium for some tobacco! We drove onto the ferry where our bikes were flung up onto their centre stands by a small but surprisingly strong deckhand. They were tied to the side by a rope. The ferry journey was short, but there were no &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croque-monsieur&quot;&gt;croque-monsieurs&lt;/a&gt; which was very disappointing. Amazingly, you could see Dover from Calais. Calais greeted us with long sandy beaches and sunshine, a bit of a contrast from rainy Dover!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once off the ferry we decided to head along the coast to Belgium to avoid the toll roads. There was no passport checking between France and Belgium, simply a small road sign that said Belgium with stars around it. In Belgium we stopped for petrol and an ice cream and decided to head for a campsite on the coast between Ostende and Brugge in a town called De Haan. After getting slightly lost we found it and set up camp in a field full of tents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it was nice and sunny, we headed off to the beach in search of food. It was a ~500m walk through some woods, and the beach its self was beautiful. It was large and sandy, stretched as far as the eye could see and had hardly anyone on it, just some couples walking along, some horses and a model having her photo taken in the freezing North Sea! We strolled along and found a café where we both had tagliatelle, Ben had a beer and I had an amazing Sangria with berries, strawberries, melon, apple and orange in. After that we strolled back to the tent and collapsed after a long exhausting day.&lt;/p&gt;</textarea></td></tr>
