We had left the panniers on the bikes in the hope it wouldn&#39;t rain, but it did so we had to dash out and get them. After trying to get some more sleep, we got up at 9 is, hastily packed, and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The route we had chosen was over some hills on some fun curvy roads - luckily on hair pins! We were rewarded with amazing scenery of valleys with towns nestled between the greenery. Once past this, it was motorway to Switzerland. However, there was a huge queue to get into the country, with loads of crazy cars reversing back the wrong way up an on slip road to avoid the queue! We sat it out which didn&#39;t take too long. There were guards sorting the lorries from the cars. But once past this we got to the border where we were told to park up and were asked where we were going. We said Luzern on the autobahns and had to cough up 60 Euros (which the guard insisted was pronounced “sixteen”) for 2 windscreen stickers. Oddly we got given 10 Swiss francs in return.&lt;/p&gt;

The Swiss roads are busy, full of roadworks and littered with impressive tunnels, some of which were over 3km long!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the campsite and set up. We are right down next to a lake, and when the cloud lifts you can see a giant mountain with snow on. It is all very scenic. We had dinner at the campsite café; very yummy! I had a chicken noodle wok thingy, and Ben had Bratwurst and chips; just what we needed after our long drive. Then we settled in with our books, played cards, and went to bed as it got dark.&lt;/p&gt;</textarea></td></tr>
