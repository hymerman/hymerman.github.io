I've started the blog again. This time it's hosted on GitHub Pages using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (with the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme), which will make adding posts *much* easier. Dave, you were right, [Bloggart](https://github.com/hymerman/bloggart) was too hard to use.

I'm not going to bother importing old posts since nobody cares about them, least of all me!
