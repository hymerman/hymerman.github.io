title: New Blog

I've started the blog again, more through necessity than choice. The old one was using [Bloggart](https://github.com/hymerman/bloggart) hosted on Google App Engine, but Google is rolling out an enforced update which will force the site to stop working in 2 days time!

I'm now hosting the blog on GitHub Pages using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) (with the [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) theme), which will make adding posts *much* easier. Dave, you were right, Bloggart was too hard to use.

I may import some old posts at some point, but they're quite inane and nobody cares about them.
